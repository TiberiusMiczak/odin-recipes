    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For this breakfast skillet mac and cheese, baked breakfast eggs nestle in a bed of mac and cheese with sausage. And the best part? It cooks completely in the skillet - no extra pot to boil the pasta necessary.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 box macaroni and cheese mix, such as Kraft® Macaroni and Cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Mexican hot sauce, such as Cholula®</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, crumbling with a spoon, until browned and no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Add in macaroni, milk, water, and powdered cheese packet and stir, using a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is just tender and mixture is thick and creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1 cup cheese. Turn off heat. </li>
        <li>Create 4 wells in the macaroni mixture and crack an egg into each well. Sprinkle remaining cheese around eggs; sprinkle evenly with salt.</li>
        <li>Bake skillet in the preheated oven until whites are just set, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle evenly with pepper and green onions and drizzle with hot sauce.</li>
    </ol>
